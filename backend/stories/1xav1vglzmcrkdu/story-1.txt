Apple's new patent introduces 'Heartbeat Unlock' for iPhone 17, using heart signals for user identification. This feature, built on the Apple Watch's ECG technology, uses hidden leads to detect cardiac signals. It promises to maintain the iPhone's sleek design while adding a new layer of security and personalization. The heart signals can even determine the user's mood. If realized, this could revolutionize iPhone security, though Face ID remains effective for now. Stay tuned for more updates on this potential game-changer.
