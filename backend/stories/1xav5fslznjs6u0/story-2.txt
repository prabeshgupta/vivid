Leave your tab open and wait. It can take a couple of hours to auto-click the close buttons, depending on the number of items you have. Google removes items with a delay, and there are 2 pop-ups; it takes about 4 seconds to remove 1 item. So you can calculate how long it would take for you. To speed up the process, you can open another tab, scroll to the bottom, and paste the script again, but this time replacing 5 with -5. It will halve the time needed for removing all comments.
