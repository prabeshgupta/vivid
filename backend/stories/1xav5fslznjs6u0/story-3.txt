It’s not a good idea to auto-click all close buttons at once, as Google still deletes them one by one with a delay and with a confirmation popup first, followed by a notification popup, so it will produce 1000 confirmations before starting to remove items if you have 1000 comments. Additionally, if you reload your page, all those items won’t be deleted as confirmation doesn’t mean deletion. Remember that the webpage removes the visual representation of comments with a delay while they are already deleted at the back-end, so don’t reload the webpage because nothing seems to change.
