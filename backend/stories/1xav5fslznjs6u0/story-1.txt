Google doesnâ€™t provide a one-click solution for removing all your comments, likes, and dislikes. However, I decided to erase all my traces for privacy reasons, so I created a console JavaScript script to automate this process. To delete all your comments go to https://myactivity.google.com/more-activity: Open your comments history(or any other) and paste script into dev console: function deleteItems(){ console.log("Removing next batch of items") Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button[aria-label*="Delete activity item"]')).slice(5).forEach((e) => {e.click()}) } deleteItems() setInterval(deleteItems, 20 * 1000) // 4 seconds per item
