Lyles' 100m victory was historic, winning by five-thousandths of a second in the fastest 100m race ever. However, his 200m race was a struggle, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and US silver medallist Kenneth Bednarek. Lyles revealed he tested positive for Covid-19 early Tuesday and quarantined with his team. Despite medication, he felt only 90-95% fit. His defeat ended hopes of winning four golds in Paris. Lyles praised his relay team, confident they could win without him.
