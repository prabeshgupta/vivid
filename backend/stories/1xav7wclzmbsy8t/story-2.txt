The heart sensor in the iPhone 17 Slim detects your heart activity and electrical signals using several small metal parts called leads. These leads are hidden inside the device, and when you touch it, the electrical signals travel from the skin to the leads through the device housing. This seamless integration ensures that the device's design remains intact while providing advanced biometric security.
