Apple's new patent reveals a way to unlock iPhones using heartbeats. The heart sensor, hidden inside the device, detects cardiac signals through the skin. This feature, likely debuting in iPhone 17 Slim, uses small metal parts called leads to pick up signals. The leads are hidden, making the device look seamless. This innovation could add a new layer of security and personalization to iPhones, recognizing users by their heart signals and even detecting their mood. Stay tuned for more updates on this groundbreaking feature.
